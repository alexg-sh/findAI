2. Type your search term
3. Use the ‚Üë and ‚Üì buttons to navigate between matches
4. Press **Esc** to close

### AI-Powered Search
1. When searching for text that doesn't exist on the page, an **"Ask"** button appears
2. Click **"Ask"** or press **Enter** to query the AI about the page content
3. The AI will analyze the page and provide relevant information
